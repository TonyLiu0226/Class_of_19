                text "They pulled him out of school immediately, said it wasn’t safe anymore. He was to complete Grade 12 online, at home, under their watchful eyes."

                text "Luckily, Justice was there to help him. The dealer who gave him the edible? Arrested that same week — charged with drug trafficking and sentenced to twelve years in prison."
            hbox:
                text "Sometimes he replayed that moment—sitting in the exam room, feeling like he had it all under control. But he didn’t. And he lost everything in the space of a heartbeat."
