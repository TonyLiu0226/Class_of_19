                text "He studied like his life depended on it. Rewrote notes. Drilled problems. Pulled all-nighters not because he was behind, but because he wanted to get ahead."
            hbox:
                text "As a result, he aced all his exams that semester. 100s. On everything."
            hbox:
                text "The momentum continued into next year, where he scored over 95% on every single unit and final test, from AP Physics to English dash 1."
            hbox:
                text "Teachers stopped grading his work with red pens — they used it as the answer key. He got a 5 on every AP exam he wrote. When SAT season rolled around, he got a perfect 1600... on his first try."
            hbox:
                text "But he didn’t stop at academics."
            hbox:
                text "He spent his spare time learning to code in a variety of languages, and building impressive projects similar in scope to what university students typically did after years of studying."

                text "All the while, he was applying to Ivy League schools across the country. He was accepted to every single one he applied to... Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Stanford, you name it."
            hbox:
                text "When the Harvard offer came... he wasn't shocked. Because, deep down in his heart, he knew he earned it."
