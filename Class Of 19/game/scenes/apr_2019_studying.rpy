    albert "Yo Alex! How was your break, bro?"

    alex "Not bad. Mostly just slept and ignored responsibility."

    albert "Classic. Me, I went downtown with my cousin... dropped like 500 bucks on these bad boys."

    alex "Five hundred? On glasses?"

    albert "Gucci, man. You gotta respect the flex."

    show alex excited at left
    alex "Can’t relate, but I respect it."

    albert "Anyway—there’s a physics test coming up, right? You wanna hit the library after school? Group study sesh."

    alex "Yeah sure. That’d probably save my grade."

    albert "Cool. We got a little squad... you’ll vibe."

    albert "Alright, question five ... object rolling down an incline. Acceleration due to gravity is 9.8, angle is 30 degrees."

    lia "Easy. a = g * sin(theta). So 9.8 * 0.5 = 4.9 m/s²."

    albert "Okay next—projectile motion. A ball is launched at 20 m/s at a 45° angle. What’s the time of flight?"

    alex "...uh, vertical velocity’s 20 * sin(45)... that’s around 14.1?"

    clara "Yep. And total time is 2 * Vy / g, so..."

    lia "2 * 14.1 / 9.8 = 2.88 seconds. Boom."

    clara "So this bar is pivoted at one end. You’ve got a force acting perpendicular at the other end. Torque is force times distance from pivot. Easy multiplication."

    alex "Okay... so 10 newtons at 2 meters is 20 newton-meters?"

    clara "Exactly. See? You’re already better than half the class."

    lia "I know. I’m like 80\% there. Maybe after the test."
