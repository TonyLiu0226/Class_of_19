    alex "Gourmet? You binge-watched Black Clover like it was a bag of Doritos."

    tanish "And I regret nothing."

    tanish "We could ask Clara for help?"

    alex "You sure? Isn't she assigned to the 100-level class?"

    tanish "Yeah, but she knows stuff. She helped Jimin fix that recursion bug last week. Remember?"

    clara "Oof. Yeah, that one's tricky. But I actually haven't finished it yet—I'm only assigned to help the first-years."

    tanish "Darn. You seemed like our last hope."

    clara "Sorry! But hey, the hint on the assignment page? It's more useful than it looks. Read the hint."

    alex "Hey—uh, thanks again for earlier. Even if you couldn't help, it… helped. Y'know?"

    clara "Of course. You guys are fun."

    alex "Do you, uh... use Discord? Maybe we could trade memes. Or debugging pain."

    clara "Memes and suffering? Sounds like my kind of chat. Here—add me."

    # [They exchange phones. SFX: Discord notification ping.]

    alex "Nice. I'll start with something cursed. Test your threshold."

    clara "Bring it on. But no JoJo memes. I've seen everything."

    alex "You're gonna regret saying that."
