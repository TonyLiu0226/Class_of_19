    gina "Awww bb don't be sad about it. What happened?"

    nicole "He's been acting so weird about it. Like, come on, it's just a couple of days, then you'll have your so called 'freedom' back."

    gina "Wait, what? When?!"

    nicole "YES. About time."

    lia "After everything he pulled this semester? He got himself expelled. Expelled."

    gina "Wait—what?!"

    lia "Yup. First of all, he literally burned this girl's hair in chem lab. I literally don't know why. Then there are these rumors about him literally threatening to molest a teacher when he was reported for that incident."

    nicole "Oh my god."

    show lia sad at mid_left

    lia "He never told any of this to me, I only knew when my friends told me they saw Principal Aarvindh yelling 'YOU'RE EXPELLED' at him when walking past the office. I was so shocked I didn't even know what to do."

    show gina neutral at center

    nicole "I'm so sorry, Lia."

    lia "Despite this, he still managed to make *me* the villain."

    gina "What?"

    lia "Said I wasn’t being ‘emotionally supportive’ enough while he was spiraling."

    nicole "Girl, you wrote his chemistry labs. You were *his* support staff."

    lia "Exactly. I'm done with the chaos."

    gina "Good. You deserve peace."

    gina "Like... on his bike. I saw him through my window. He called me while he was standing across the street."

    lia "You're kidding."

    nicole "That’s so creepy."

    gina "He said he didn’t want to ambush me, and that he just wanted to talk. He looked all nervous."

    show lia neutral at mid_left

    lia "Girl, no. No no no."

    nicole "That is stalker behavior, not sweet. Do not romanticize it."

    gina "I didn’t. I mean, we talked. But it freaked me out at first."

    lia "As it should’ve. You need to draw the line."

    nicole "You really should block him. If he ever comes near your house again, you call the cops. No hesitation."

    show gina neutral at center

    gina "...I guess part of me still feels bad."

    lia "Feeling bad is fine. Just don’t let it override common sense."
