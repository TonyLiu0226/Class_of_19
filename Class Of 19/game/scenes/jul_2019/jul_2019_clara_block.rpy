    lia "OMG... I'm at my wits end with Jade. If she complains one more time about being left out when she’s the one ditching hangouts, I'm gonna scream."

    gina "Lemme guess... this is about the pool party?"

    lia "Yes! She literally RSVP’d 'maybe' and then ghosted for three days. Then said she had to do something for her drug dealer."

    show gina happy at center

    gina "*laughs* That’s... creative."

    lia "Why is she obsessed with it in the first place? She isn't the type to get high, so she's definitely reselling that shit."

    show gina blush at center

    gina "Interesting way to make a few bucks... I guess..."

    lia "Yet, this morning I got a text from her saying she's been feeling a bit lonely lately... Like hello? You literally ditched a pool party just to make a bit of dirty money."

    gina "Maybe it's a side effect of the weed?"

    lia "Nah bb. Even if she smoked it, I'm pretty sure she’s addicted to drama more than weed."

    show gina neutral at center

    gina "So what now?"

    lia "I'm done. No more Jade invites. Let her throw her pity parties with her dealer."

    pause

    lia "Speaking of people who don’t get the hint... anything from Alex?"

    gina "No. Not since that night."

    lia "So he hasn’t shown up again or tried to message you?"

    gina "Not that I’ve seen. Nothing weird on Discord either."

    show lia blush at left

    lia "That’s... surprising. Kinda expected another midnight bike ride."

    show gina happy at center

    gina "*laughs weakly* Yeah… me too, honestly."

    pause

    lia "You blocked him, though… right?"

    show gina embarrassed at center

    gina "...No. Not yet."

    lia "Gina."

    show gina neutral at center

    gina "I know, I know. I just… it feels so final. Like I’m shutting the door for good."

    show lia neutral at left

    lia "He showed up to your house. That’s not a crush, that’s obsession."

    gina "It didn’t feel dangerous. Just… sad. Like he’s lost or something."

    lia "That’s not your problem to solve. You owe him nothing, especially after everything."

    pause

    lia "Look. He’s probably watching your profile right now, waiting for any little sign."

    show gina embarrassed at center

    gina "...Okay. You’re right... But I really don't want to hurt his feelings."

    lia "Girl, no... You need to prioritize yourself over him."

    gina "I know. But what if Alex gets mad and then bikes to my house again, this time in an angry mood? He might even try to hurt me."

    lia "That's what the cops are for. You see him even near your house, you call them. Do not open the door."

    gina "Geez... Lia you're making me more worried now..."

    show lia neutral at mid_left

    lia "I know it'll be hard. But I got your back. Here, pass me your phone."
