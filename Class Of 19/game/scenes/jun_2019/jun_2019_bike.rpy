    gina "Are you serious? You’re across the street?!"

    alex "I didn’t want to just show up and ring your doorbell. I thought calling would be better."

    gina "Alex—this is not cool. This is exactly what I was afraid of."

    alex "I know. I messed up. I didn’t mean to come off like a stalker or anything, I just—"

    gina "Bruh"

    alex "I didn’t know how else to say it. Things felt off. You were going cold, and I didn’t know if I should back off or say something."

    pause

    gina "Look... I get it. I’ve been distant. Finals, family stuff... and yeah, I was unsure about you."

    gina "But this? This is the behavior I was afraid of especially when others have mentioned your past tendencies in middle school."

    alex "...Yeah. I know."

    gina "But I also know you’re not Bobby. You actually bothered to call and commnuicate your feelings."

    alex "I didn’t want to make things worse. I just wanted to understand where we stand."

    gina "Then let’s talk."

    gina "It’s not that I hate you. I don’t."

    alex "That’s... a relief."

    gina "But I’ve felt boxed in. Like if I didn’t reply to a message, I was a villain."

    alex "I wasn’t trying to pressure you."

    gina "I know. But pressure doesn't always need intent. It’s about how it lands."

    alex "Then what now?"

    gina "We take space. But we stay honest. No assumptions. No ghosting. No more unnecessary bike trips."

    alex "Fair."

    pause

    gina "Anyways, thanks for calling first."

    alex "Thanks for hearing me out."

    gina "How is studying for physics going?"

    show alex excited at left

    alex "Oh god... When Manias told the class what was going to be on the final, everyone groaned. And I don't think I'm ready at all."

    gina "Lia told me she’s not even believing him in the slightest, because Manias knows he can't make the whole class fail."

    alex "Honestly... That's a good way of looking at it."

    show gina happy at right

    gina "But... If you fail, I’m not tutoring you again."

    alex "You say that every time."

    gina "And every time you end up sending me blurry pics of your worksheet at 11PM."

    alex "Guilty."

    show gina neutral at right

    gina "Alright. You should head home."

    alex "Yeah... good luck with the studying."

    gina "You too."

    show gina neutral at center

    gina "We talked. It wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be."

    albert "So...?"

    gina "So, we’re still figuring it out. But at least we’re doing it like people, not a CW drama."

    albert "Proud of you."

    gina "Shut up and let's grab some ice cream. I'm craving it."
