    alex "With Cindy?"

    bobby "Yeah. Back when I said that dumb line during the Gatsby screening? Things tanked after that. I thought it was over."

    alex "I remember. You disappeared for like a week."

    bobby "I didn’t know how to talk to her without making it worse. But eventually I did. I apologized. I explained myself. I gave her space — but I also gave her clarity."

    alex "So you think I should reach out?"

    bobby "If you care, yeah. Don’t ghost her out of pride. And don’t keep throwing half-hearted texts either."

    alex "But what if it makes her more uncomfortable?"

    bobby "Then let her say that. But let it be clear. Like... tell her how you feel, and ask her straight if she still wants to keep talking."

    alex "It feels scary."

    bobby "So is guessing forever. At least this way, it’s honest. That’s what worked with Cindy. Even if it was awkward."

    alex "And if it doesn’t work?"

    bobby "Then at least you gave it a shot. You won’t be stuck wondering ‘what if’ all summer."
