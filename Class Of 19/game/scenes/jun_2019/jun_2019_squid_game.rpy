    bobby "Yep agreed... What better way to than let's say... more time with the big screen?"

    cindy "Okay. Don’t judge me, but I already queued up the first episode."

    bobby "...Of what?"

    cindy "*Squid Game.*"

    cindy "You watched all of *Wednesday* because Twitter told you to."

    bobby "...That’s different. She blinked once and I was sold."

    cindy "Then you’ll survive *Squid Game*. Come on—just one episode. If you hate it, I’ll let you pick the next show. Even if it’s, like, *Attack on Titan* again."

    bobby "...Tempting."

    bobby "Ugh, fine. But if someone dies in the first five minutes, I reserve the right to mock you relentlessly."
