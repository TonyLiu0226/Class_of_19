    #[Background: Quiet classroom with late-day sun casting long shadows. Papers, red pens, and rubrics scattered across a table. Soft hum of hallway activity outside.]

    chatjippity "Appreciate you two sticking around. I’ve got to head out early today, but I trust you to get the drafts started for the media project rubric."

    bobby "No problem. Should we aim for detailed feedback or just wing it with 'good,' 'meh,' and 'yikes'?"

    chatjippity "Let’s not traumatize the students, Bobby. Just keep it clear and constructive. Use 'Excellent,' 'Satisfactory,' and 'Needs Work' for each category—things like clarity, creativity, multimedia use."

    alex "You got it. Rubrics of justice, coming right up."

    chatjippity "I’ll check in tomorrow. Don’t burn the place down."

    alex "So… do we give points for effort? Like if someone narrates their whole project in ASMR?"

    bobby "Only if they whisper the citations."

    alex "So helpful."

    gina "Hey—what are you two still doing here? I saw Alex through the door looking way too intense for 4 PM."

    alex "Volunteer hours. We're helping Chatjippity build rubrics for the media project. He bailed and left us in charge."

    bobby "It’s basically a power trip disguised as community service."

    gina "Sounds like fun. Need backup?"

    alex "Absolutely. We’re rapidly losing perspective on what 'creativity' even means."

    bobby "If you’ve ever suffered through an iMovie project, you’re qualified."

    gina "Cool. So, what counts as 'Excellent' for multimedia use? No star wipes?"

    alex "Excuse you—star wipes are the peak of amateur editing."

    bobby "Star wipes are what happen when a group project has no designated editor and five people argue in iMovie at 2 a.m."

    gina "I’ve lived that timeline."

    gina "Okay, hear me out: should we reward originality even if the execution sucks?"

    alex "You mean like, if someone tries to animate their whole project but the audio is out of sync and their transitions give you vertigo?"

    bobby "Honestly... yeah. At least they tried. That’s worth something."

    gina "So maybe under 'Creativity' we give them full marks for bold attempts, but under 'Technical Quality' we gently roast them?"

    alex "I support kind, educational roasting."

    bobby "4 – Technically flawed but spiritually ambitious."

    gina "That’s going in the final draft."

    alex "Okay, fair. But I did organize my desktop once."

    show bobby happy at left
    bobby "Then cluttered it again with 800 downloads titled '\'.pdf'."

    gina "Honestly, relatable. My desktop’s just chaos and vibes."

    alex "Next volunteer project: Marie Kondoing our file systems."

    bobby "Yeah. It’s weird—school’s so packed, but sometimes it feels like you never actually talk to anyone."

    alex "I mean, unless you count memes as communication."

    gina "Memes are communication. Just chaotic ones."

    alex "Wait—you and Bobby haven’t even added each other yet, right?"

    bobby "Careful. Say that too loud and he’ll make us rubric consultants for every class."

    alex "Benefits include free marker fumes and occasional hallway fame."
