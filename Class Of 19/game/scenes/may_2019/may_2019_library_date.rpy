    cindy "Oh god."

    bobby "You got this. It’s outer function to the power of 4, right?"

    cindy "So... 4(3x² + 1)^3?"

    bobby "Yep. Now chain rule—the inner derivative?"

    cindy "6x?"

    bobby "Perfect."

    pause

    cindy "So the whole derivative is... 4(3x² + 1)^3 * 6x"

    show bobby happy at mid_right
    bobby "Which is... 24x(3x² + 1)^3. Nailed it."
